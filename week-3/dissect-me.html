What is an <html> tag?
The <html> tag tells the browser that this is an HTML document and also represents the root of an HTML document.  The <html> tag is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the <!DOCTYPE> tag).

What is a <head> tag?  What information should be in the <head> tag?
Head is behind the scenes, most info isn't seen by user.  The <head> element is a container for all the head elements.  The <head> element can include a title for the document, scripts, styles, meta information, and more.  The following elements can go inside the <head> element:
<title>(this element is required in an HTML document) <style><base> <link><meta>

What purpose does the <title> tag accomplish?

Title tags define the title of a document, and there can only be one per page.  Title tags often show up in the top of a browser's tabs.  Title tags (elements) are very important for search engine optimization, because it is the main text that describes the online document.  Google typically displays the first 50-60 characters of a title tag.


What information should live in the <body> tag?
The <body> tag defines the body of the document, and like <title> should only exist once.  The <body> element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as text, hyperlinks, images, tables, lists, etc.  Breaking down a body tag with these elements allows for "easy" styling with CSS.  The <body> element should start immediately after the closing <head> tag and end directly before the closing <html> tag.
