        <h2>Every class is an instance of a class called Class! - Technical Blog</h2>

As I’ve been learning Ruby, I’ve been working with various types — numbers, strings, arrays, and hashes. Ruby calls these things classes. 
</p>
<p>
A class is best described as a blueprint - the blueprint tells Ruby how a class should be structured and what it should do.  For example, a blueprint of a car would show how a car can be made, however it would not go into details about an individual car, like the color.   </p>

<p>In Ruby, a class definition is a region of code between the keywords "class" and "end". A def inside this region begins the definition of a method of the class, which corresponds to some specific behavior for objects of that class.</p>

<p>It’s pretty simple to create a class, and since Ruby is cool, we can make them like real-world objects.  Here I've created a pretty useless Name class.</p>

<p>The class name should be capitalized, as in the example below:</p>
<code>
<p>
  class Name
  def title
    "Mr."
  end

  def first_name
    "Worthington"
  end

  def middle_name
    "Zhang"
  end

  def last_name
    "Shufflebottom"
  end
end
</p>
</code>

<p>
By defining basic classes, we can use some of Ruby’s nice little features to make setting up the boilerplate code much easier.  A Class method is a piece of functionality that belongs to that class, but is not tied to any particular single instance.  Instance Methods on the other hand, can only be called on a particular instance of the class.</p>

<code><p>
class Walmart
  def self.find(id)
    puts "#{id}"
  end
 
  def products
    []
  end
end
</p></code>

<p>In the example above, "products" is an Instance method.  You use Instance Methods when you need to act on a particular instance of the class.
