## What is a wireframe?

A wireframe is a basic visual representation of elements on a website - a sketch of the page layout, before any design elements or development takes place.  Wireframes can be pencil drawings or sketches on a whiteboard, or can produced by a wide array of free or commercial software apps.  This is a common early step in many engineering processes (vehicle building or architecture, for example) not unlike a blueprint.  

## What are the benefits of wireframing?

A Wireframe lets you establish the hierarchy of information on the page, allowing you to map out where the most important elements of the site will go (e.g. calls to action, donate button, sign up form).  Wire framing also helps to simplify communication with client you are designing for, eliminating potential distractions such as colors and fonts, and making the focus site functionality and what goes where, before moving forward.  Wire framing makes design changes more efficient, allowing many small changes (like header/footer size tweak) to be handled quickly and cheaply before getting into costly, full-blown, high-fidelity designs.

## Did you enjoy wireframing your site?  Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

I enjoyed wire framing my site.  I had difficulty with the first few “free” online wireframing tools I tried, but had a great time working with balsamiq.com.  Interestingly, part of the difficulty of this challenge has to do with how basic my site is.  I didn’t need a lot of wire!  I definitely revised it a few times, and had to look at other examples of personal websites.  I’ve noticed I spend a lot more time on either news sites, e-commerce or simple blogs, which have entirely different design elements.  

## What questions did you ask during this challenge?  What resources did you find to help you answer them?

Where will I find content for my site?  Who will visit?  Should I use more images or text?  I found many helpful online resources including wikipedia, sixrevisions.com/, and some YouTube videos with wireframes being white boarded by hand.  

## Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

I enjoyed most of the challenge and am starting to feel comfortable with the command line and Git/GitHub now.  The repetition is having its desired effect.  I also enjoy researching these creative elements of web design.  This is exactly what I was missing in my career.  I found GitHub going down last night to be tedious.
