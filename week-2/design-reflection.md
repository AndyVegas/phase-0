The six phases of web design are - information gathering, planning, design, development, testing and delivery and maintenence
```

```
## What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

This will be the start of my professional website where I can share my work history, background, passions, and past projects as well as a blog. I hope to use this site to meet potential employers.
```

```
## What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience would be web development companies, and as such I would like to somewhat mimic the UX of their business sites.  Clean professional lines, positive but neutral colors.  
```

```
## What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

I want the site to be inviting and flow beautifully.  I imagine it will be a while before I have much searchable data on there, but I would essentially like them to learn about me and review my portfolio by clicking around the pages.  If this is a résumé of sorts, then I have to assume my target audience will not spend long looking at my site - even less time if it is clunky and repels the user.  The final goal would be for the user to contact me, possibly with an employment opportunity.

## What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

Web design is about problem solving and UX is is about performance and aesthetics
```

```
## What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

User experience (abbreviated as UX) is how a person feels when interfacing with a system and the process of enhancing user satisfaction.  It encompasses visual design, information architecture (structure, organization and labeling), interaction design and usability.  User experience is an emerging, but important aspect of design incorporating behavioral science, web development, and domain-specific knowledge, humanizing the sterile online environment.  Here are some important stats highlighting the importance of good UX design:

*88% of online consumers are less likely to return to a site after a bad experience. @econsultancy

*94% of a user’s first impressions are design-related. - @Veopix

## Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I am noticing the the assignment hand-holding of week 1 is over!  Researching above and beyond the provided info was tedious and I had some difficulty with release 3 - adding my site map.  After re-reading I was able to work out the issue.
