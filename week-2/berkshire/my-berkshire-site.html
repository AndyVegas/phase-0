<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was great!  It's terrific to hit "save" and "refresh" and instantly see your changes happen!
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
Excellent.  I watched some Team Treehouse videos and read as much as I could from the Jon Duckett book!
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
Not a problem.  I look forward to the CSS portion next week.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
HTML seems like a great next step after learning about wireframing.  Once you have a nice layout, you can build the HTML without the distraction of colors and other design elements that can be added later.  
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
I like to type out the two brackets <> before filling them in!  The active learning that comes with working with a partner helps alot too!
