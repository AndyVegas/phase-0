### Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

1. https://github.com/AndyVegas/AndyVegas.github.io

### Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

2. Creating a new repository is easy!  You simply pick a short name, add an optional description, decide if you want a public or private repo, and add a license, granting specific permissions for others to use your work!n  Cloning is similarly easy, and done so the repo in question exists on your computer, locally.  This is done using the command line, checking first to make sure you're in a acceptable directory.  Never clone a repo into another GitHub repo!  First you have to copy the clone URL from the GitHub page and then add it to the command line after "git clone", like so:
git clone URL_THAT_YOU_COPIED

### Describe what open source means.

3. Open source is when developers share their source code freely, to be modified and redistributed.  

### What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

4. I love the idea of open source - it does feel like a utopia or sorts, where everyone is able to build on what has come before.  It feels like faster advancement.  I also love that intelligent businesses can apply the open source philosophy and still be very profitable, Google being one example.  Telsa also recently open sourced their patents.  

### Assess the importance of using licenses.

5. Licenses are an important legal aspect of software development, and engineering of any kind.  They typically involve governing the use or redistribution of software and are necessary in matters of piracy and copyright infringement.  

### What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

6. Forking and cloning and [very basic] use of the Mac Terminal really worked for me during this assignment.  I was in a flow of sorts.

### Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

7. https://help.github.com is very helpful to me.  The little messages that pop up in Terminal are helpful as well (git push --help).  Too many other sites to list!
